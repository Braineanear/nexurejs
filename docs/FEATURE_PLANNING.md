  - Automatic cache invalidation strategies

#### Database Connectivity
- **Connection Pooling**
  - Smart connection acquisition with priority queuing
  - Connection health monitoring
  - Graceful handling of database failovers
  - Query batching and result streaming

### 4. Security Enhancements

#### Authentication
- **Integrated Auth Providers**
  - JWT handling with minimal overhead
  - OAuth 2.0 client and server implementations
  - Session management with security best practices
  - Multi-factor authentication support

#### Input Validation
- **Schema-based Validation**
  - Fast JSON schema validation with native acceleration
  - Custom validators with performance optimizations
  - Automatic sanitization of inputs
  - Type coercion with configuration options

#### Protection Mechanisms
- **Security Headers**
  - Content Security Policy (CSP) builder
